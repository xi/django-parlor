# django-parlor

Django model translations with even less nasty hacks.

## Installation

```
pip install django-parlor
```

## Usage

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.db import models

from parlor.admin import TranslatableAdmin
from parlor.models import TranslatableModel


class MyModel(TranslatableModel):
    ...


class MyModelTranslation(model.Model):
    parent = MyModel.get_parent_field()
    language_code = MyModel.get_lang_field()

    label = models.CharField(max_length=32)
    ...

    class Meta:
        unique_together = [('parent', 'language_code')]


admin.site.register(MyModel, TranslatableAdmin)

animal = MyModel.objects.create()
animal.translations.create(language_code='en', label='Frog')
animal.translations.create(language_code='de', label='Frosch')
print(animal.label)
```

## Status

Right now this is more of a proof-of-concept. If people are interested in this
library it could certainly be expanded.

## Relation to django-parler

### Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

There are two popular libraries for model translation in Django:
[django-modeltranslation](https://github.com/deschler/django-modeltranslation)
and [django-parler](https://github.com/django-parler/django-parler). The former
adds additional columns to the same table while the latter adds a new table for
each translatable model. Both of these libraries use a lot of magic which makes
them easy to use, but also leads to some hard-to-debug edge cases.

There is also
[django-translated-fields](https://github.com/matthiask/django-translated-fields),
which uses the same basic approach as django-modeltranslation, but with much
less magic (and much less lines of code).

Here I try to do something similar for django-parler, which has been
unmaintained for some time now.

### Migration

If you want to migrate from django-parler to django-parlor, you need to replace
all instances of `parler.TranslatedFields` by explicit translation models as
described above. Note that the `parent` field is called `master` in
django-parler.

To keep using the same data, you will also need to set `Meta.db_table` to the
name generated by django-parler (typically `myapp_mymodel_translation`).

Finally you should run `manage.py makemigrations`. The generated migrations
will only contain minor changes though.

### Conceptual differences

-   With django-parlor, the translation model must be created explicitly.
-   In the admin UI, django-parlor uses a stock inline instead of a custom
    tabbed interface.
-   django-parlor only provides basic attribute access while django-parler
    provides a lot more features.
